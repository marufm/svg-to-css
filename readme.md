This browser based tool will take your svg files and create embeddable css/scss/less for you.

1. Fork, Download, Open up little app in your modern browser of choice.
2. Drag-n-Drop your svg icons into the browser window
3. Check your svgs and remove if you need to
4. Select your encoding and language
5. Get the code you need?

## How does it work then?

Well to break it down:

1. Use drag-n-drop api to get content of the files.
2. Escape & process svgs

## Why does this exist? Y U NO use grumpicon or grunt?

I made the very first version of this while working in an agency in 2013. I was really desperate for an automated svg production method. At that time I didnt even know grunt/node/grumpicon existed.
